        <h3><strong>Forget about deep frying, and give your hush puppies a light update using an air fryer.</strong></h3>
        <p>They're just a bit denser in texture than deep frying, and look for a subtle hint of heat. They're the perfect sidekick to fried fish or shrimp, but they're equally good with a drizzle of honey.</p>
        
        <p>You can use any color bell pepper that you prefer.Air fryers heat differently, so check occasionally for doneness.If you need to cook in batches, put all hush puppies back into the fryer at the end, and give them a quick reheat for 1 to 2 minutes.I ended up with 12 good-size hush puppies using the 2 tablespoon cookie scoop, but if you like them smaller, just be sure to adjust your cooking time.</p>
